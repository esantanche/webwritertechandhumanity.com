                <p>Hi there,</p>

                <p>This is Emanuele Santanche writing!</p>

                <p>I want to tell you about my writing process.</p>

                <p>Every writer has their unique, personal writing process.</p>

                <p>It's something like this:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Research</li>
                    <li>Do free writing</li>
                    <li>Create the outline</li>
                    <li>Write</li>
                    <li>Rewrite</li>
                    <li>Finalise</li>
                </ul>

                <p>My process has something special in addition.</p>

                <p>Before every step I smile.</p>

                <p>It's to remind myself that one of the main reasons for which I write is to heal.</p>

                <p>Sometimes there is really nothing to smile about. There is suffering going on, my smile becomes one of compassion.</p>

                <p>It happens that I forget to smile. It's because I am human, I am not a robot.</p>

                <p>I am a nomad.</p>

                <p>I have lived in Italy, France and the UK.</p>

                <p>In the past travel was one of the best ways to learn. It still is.</p>

                <p>It spices up my writing and highlights my uniqueness.</p>

                <p>I have worked for a long time in software.</p>

                <p>I love to make things work.</p>

                <p>It started when I was a teen and it felt like play.</p>

                <p>It continued with a long experience in understanding what motivation is and why it matters.</p>

                <p>At a given point in my life, it seemed to me that it was more important for us as a species to make society work than to produce some new high-tech gadget.</p>

                <p>I realised that modern society wasn't meeting one of the most important human needs, the need to grow, psychologically I mean.</p>

                <p>As an engineer I wanted to understand, study and see what I could do about it.</p>

                <p>I helped a lot of people, mostly depressed teenagers.</p>

                <p>What if we start?</p>

                <p>Go to my <a href="https://webwritertechandhumanity.com/item/134/contact-me" target="_blank">contact-me page</a> and leave me a message!</p>

                <p>I can't wait to know more about you.</p>

                <p>A smile,</p>

                <p>Emanuele</p>
